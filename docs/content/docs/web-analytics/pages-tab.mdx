## The Pages Tab

The Pages tab provides detailed analysis of every URL on your site. While the Main tab shows top pages, the Pages tab gives you the full picture with advanced filtering and sorting.

### Pages Table

The main feature here is a comprehensive table listing every page tracked on your site.

Each row shows:
- **Page URL**: Full path or truncated display
- **Average Time on Page**: How long visitors spend there
- **Sessions**: Number of sessions for each page

### Filtering on the Pages Tab

You can also use the filter tab near the top left of the panel to filter just like in the main dashboard.

Combine filters for detailed analysis:
- Mobile users from social media
- Desktop users who converted
- First-time visitors versus returning
- Users who triggered specific events

### Identifying Problem Pages

The Pages tab makes it easy to spot underperforming content:

1. See the pages with the lowest average time on page
2. Look for pages with least sessions

### Using Pages Tab Insights

Here's what to do with the data:

**Content Audit**: Sort by pageviews to find your most popular content. These pages deserve regular updates and optimization.

**SEO Opportunities**: Check entry pages with high traffic but low average time on page. These rank well but don't deliver what searchers expect. Adjust content or meta descriptions.
