## The Goals Tab

Goals let you track specific outcomes you care about. Did users sign up? Did they complete checkout? Did they view key pages? The Goals tab helps you measure success.

### Creating Your First Goal

Click "Create Goal" to open the goal setup interface.

You'll need to provide:

**Goal Name**: Something descriptive like "Newsletter Signup" or "Purchase Complete"

**Goal Type**: Choose between:
- Page path goals (user visits a specific URL)
- Event goals (user triggers a custom event)

**Target**: The page path or event name to track

**Value** (optional): Assign a monetary value to conversions

### Page Path Goals

Page path goals trigger when users visit specific URLs. Common examples:

- Thank you pages after form submission
- Order confirmation pages after checkout
- Onboarding completion pages
- Download confirmation pages

Enter the URL path exactly as it appears in your analytics. Use wildcards for dynamic URLs:
- `/thank-you` matches exactly `/thank-you`
- `/thank-you*` matches `/thank-you`, `/thank-you?ref=email`, etc.
- `/order/*/confirmation` matches `/order/12345/confirmation`

### Event Goals

Event goals trigger when custom events fire. You need to have custom event tracking implemented first.

Common event goals:
- Button clicks ("signup_clicked")
- Video completions ("video_complete")
- Form submissions ("contact_form_submitted")
- Feature usage ("premium_feature_used")

Events offer more flexibility than page goals. You can track actions that don't result in page loads.

### Viewing Goal Performance

After creating goals, the Goals tab displays your conversion metrics.

*Image: Overview of all active goals*

For each goal, you'll see:
- **Conversion Count**: How many times this goal converted
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of sessions that converted
- **Total Value**: Sum of all conversion values (if set)
- **Trend**: Up or down compared to previous period

### Conversion Funnel Analysis

Click any goal to see detailed funnel analysis. This shows the path users take before converting.

The funnel reveals:
- Top entry pages for converting sessions
- Most common paths to conversion
- Where drop-offs happen
- Average time to conversion

This analysis helps you:
- Optimize high-converting entry points
- Fix pages where users drop off
- Understand the customer journey
- Reduce time to conversion

### Goals by Traffic Source

See which channels drive the most conversions. The Goals tab breaks down conversions by source.

Compare conversion rates across:
- Organic search
- Social media
- Direct traffic
- Referrals
- Paid campaigns

Maybe organic search converts at 5% while social converts at 1%. This tells you where to focus acquisition efforts.

### Goals by Device

Device type affects conversion rates. Mobile users often convert less than desktop users, but that varies by industry.

If mobile conversion rates lag significantly, you need mobile optimization. Focus on:
- Simplifying mobile checkout flows
- Reducing form fields
- Improving mobile page speed
- Testing tap targets and button sizes

### Setting Conversion Value

Assigning values to goals lets you track revenue or value generated through your site.

Set values based on:
- Average order value (for purchases)
- Estimated lead value (for B2B sites)
- Lifetime value estimates (for signups)
- Advertising value (for pageviews)

With values set, the Goals tab shows total value generated, making ROI calculations straightforward.

### Multiple Goals

Most sites should track several goals. Create goals for:

**Top of Funnel**:
- Newsletter signups
- Free trial starts
- Resource downloads

**Middle of Funnel**:
- Product page views
- Demo requests
- Add to cart actions

**Bottom of Funnel**:
- Purchase completions
- Account creation
- Premium upgrades

![Screenshot showing multiple active goals]

Tracking multiple goals shows you the complete picture. Maybe signups are up but purchases are down. Or downloads increase but signups decline. These patterns inform strategy.

### Time to Conversion

For each goal, see how long it takes users to convert after their first visit.

![Screenshot of time to conversion chart]
*Image: Conversion timing distribution*

Most conversions happen:
- Immediately (same session)
- Within 24 hours
- Within a week
- Or longer

Understanding conversion timing helps you:
- Set appropriate retargeting windows
- Adjust email follow-up schedules
- Measure campaign effectiveness over correct timeframes
- Identify quick wins versus nurture needs

### Goals vs Funnels

Goals track single conversion events. Funnels (covered elsewhere) track multi-step processes. Use both together:

- **Goals**: Track end results (signup completed, purchase made)
- **Funnels**: Analyze the steps leading to those results (viewed product → added to cart → proceeded to checkout → completed purchase)

### Using Goals Effectively

Get the most from goals by:

**Start with Core Conversions**: Track your most important business outcomes first. Don't create dozens of goals immediately.

**Add Context with Segments**: Don't just track overall conversion rates. Segment by source, device, and location to understand what drives success.

**Set Benchmarks**: Record current conversion rates, then track improvements. Did your optimization increase conversions by 10%? You'll know.

**Monitor Trends**: Weekly checks catch problems early. If conversion rates suddenly drop, investigate immediately.

**Test and Learn**: Try changes, measure impact on goals, keep what works. Goals make experimentation measurable.

**Assign Ownership**: Someone should own each goal and work to improve it. Goals without owners don't improve.

### Goal Alerts (Coming Soon)

Future Rybbit versions will include goal alerts. Get notified when:
- Conversion rates drop below thresholds
- A goal hits target numbers
- Conversion patterns change significantly

For now, check goals regularly to catch changes early.
