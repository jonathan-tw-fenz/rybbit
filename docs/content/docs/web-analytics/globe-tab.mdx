# Understanding the Globe dashboard in Rybbit Analytics

### What You'll See

When you open the Globe tab, you're greeted with an interactive map showing where your visitors connect from. The interface offers two visualization modes: 2D and 3D.

#### 2D Map View

The 2D map has four options, timeline, coordinates, countries and subdivisions.

- Timeline: Timeline allows you to view all of your sessions by a specific timeframe geographically on the map, you can select different timeframes (1h, 1m, etc..) and also click on each session individually to view the session details.
- Coordinates: Coordinates view allows you to view sessions as dots on the map, with varying color intensities and dot sizes meaning different numbers of visitors, you can click a dot and see all the sessions associated with that dot.
- Countries: Countries with more traffic appear highlighted, with color intensity showing traffic volume. Darker colors mean more visitors.
- Subdivisions: Subdivisions is a more granualar version of the countries view, you can view sessions by each partiuclar national subdivision.

### Time Controls

Like the Main tab, the Globe tab includes full time controls. Pick your date range and watch the map adjust to show traffic for that period.

Compare this week to last week. See how geographic distribution changes over time. Spot growing markets or declining regions.

### Filtering on the Globe Tab

You can also use the filter tab near the top left of the panel to filter just like in the main dashboard.

Apply filters to see geographic distribution for specific segments. Want to see where your mobile users come from? Apply a device filter and watch the map update.

Combine filters for detailed analysis:
- Mobile users from social media
- Desktop users who converted
- First-time visitors versus returning
- Users who triggered specific events

The Globe tab respects all your filters, making it a powerful segmentation tool.


#### 3D Globe View (Optional)

You can also get access to a 3D globe. This transforms your traffic data into a stunning visual experience.

The 3D map has the same four options as the 2D map has, timeline, coordinates, countries and subdivisions.

- Timeline: Timeline allows you to view all of your sessions by a specific timeframe geographically on the map, you can select different timeframes (1h, 1m, etc..) and also click on each session individually to view the session details.
- Coordinates: Coordinates view allows you to view sessions as dots on the map, with varying color intensities and dot sizes meaning different numbers of visitors, you can click a dot and see all the sessions associated with that dot.
- Countries: Countries with more traffic appear highlighted, with color intensity showing traffic volume. Darker colors mean more visitors.
- Subdivisions: Subdivisions is a more granualar version of the countries view, you can view sessions by each partiuclar national subdivision.

The 3D globe lets you:
- Rotate by dragging
- Zoom in and out
- See traffic hotspots glow

Perfect for monitoring launches, campaigns, or just watching your site's reach in action.

Note: The 3D view requires a Mapbox API token. For self-hosted installations, add `MAPBOX_TOKEN` to your environment variables. The cloud version includes this automatically.

### Using the Globe Tab Effectively

Here's how to get the most from this feature:

**Monitor Launches**: Keep the Globe tab open during product launches or content releases. Watch traffic arrive from different regions in real-time.

**Identify Growth Markets**: Check the Globe tab weekly to spot emerging markets. If traffic from a new region increases, that's your signal to consider localization or regional targeting.

**Impress Stakeholders**: The 3D globe makes a fantastic visual for presentations. Show executives where your users actually are.
